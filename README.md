# DHH23 Portfolio

This is a repository for my individual portfolio for the [DHH23](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/digital-humanities/helsinki-digital-humanities-hackathon-2023-dhh23) Early Modern Theme. The group explored reuse in scientific illustrations in the 18th century.

In this portfolio, I 
1) evaluated the quality of the reuse algorithm
2) identified widely reused images and publications.
3) Did a case study of one reused plate of Linn√©'s classification system.
